# RUS fast castle

* 4 vils to food
* 2 vils build a hunting cabin and a house then back to food
* 7 vils to sheep
* Make 2 scouts
* Make a Golden Gate with 4 vils, take every vil on sheep except 3 to wood
* Next vils to wood
* Research professional scouts and survival techniques
* Make a wooden fortress asap on the wood line
* Build hunting cabins near the wood for the gold (make sure they donâ€™t overlap), when you have 4, distribute your vils to have something like 15/7/0/0
* Next vils to food
* Make the Abbey with 10 vils, make a few archery ranges
* Try to stay 50/50 between food and wood
* Spam horse archers and scouts and you should win against any civ from that point

Then take relics and sacred sites, eventually add a blacksmith and more ranges, hunt boars,..
Use your gold only on blacksmith upgrades and traders
