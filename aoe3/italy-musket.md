# Italy Musket Spam

the goal is to enter commercial age with a strong eco and to quickly build a army to defend until mercs can be deployed.
the problem with italy is that they start with only 3 settlers and do not have access to settler shipments. to make up
for this weakness, they receive a settler for every tech they research.

still they lag behind in commercial age speed. this strat remedies that by allowing you to go commercial with
a reasonable time, an excellent eco and enough pop space to quickly grow a musket/parvesier/hussar army which
will soon be complemented by mercs.
lombards only come in late commercial - don't go crazy with them - they just allow you to keep concentrating
on food for the entire game but ARE NOT NEEDED INSTANTLY!
from fortress age on, italy becomes rather fearsome anyway due to papal units. key in fortress age is to build up
a strong cav force centered on papal lancers and hussars, complemented by crabat, mounted infantry and natives
(if available). add dragoons later on if up against other cav-centric civs.
italy is an excellent cav civ!

what this strat delivers is:
- a 5:00 commercial time with
- 16 villager population
- all tier1 market techs researched (depending on treasures + tier2 hunting)
- 30 pop space

Build Order:
- one vill goes to hunt, 2 to crates
- set tc gather point to hunt
- explorer collects treasures. don't scout the enemy base, go all for resource treasures! you will use the marco polo
  shipment (or crabats) later on to scout
- architect queues buildings in front of base: house, market, house, house
- ship in capitalism
- as soon as you have the market up and 50c, research hunting dogs
- age up with 12/20 pop (let tc idle if not at 800f) with the 500f politician.
  some idle tc time is not that bad, since you keep on building vills at the market while ageing up
- take half of your settlers to wood, leave the rest on food, none to gold
- research all remaining market tier1 techs, start with steel traps if you have the resources
- tc gather point remains on hunt
- on reaching age2, make the architect take a break from house building and build a rax, pay for the foundation to get
  it up quickly
- send in 6 muskets as first shipment
- queue 5 muskets
- architect resumes house, then queue another house, another rax, house, house, stable, house, house, lombard
- keep on queueing pavesiers and muskets depending on resources
- next card is 3 taverns, use them to collect gold - you do not yet need any vills on gold. build the taverns so that
  they extend the perimeter of your base.
- next card is the basilika, place it so that it affects your rax and stable
- you should have come under attack by now and be able to repel it
- if your enemy withdraws, follow him and do as much damage as you can while queueing up more rax units
- set tc gather point to gold and military shipment point to basilika
- research the basilika techs (better line of sight and faster training)
- your next goal is to balance your resources (use the lombard for this) and ship mercs: the three age2 merc shipments
  that cost 300f+300w+300c are one of italy's main strengths.
- use the cav mercs to raid relentlessly, don't panic if your enemy goes fortress age - just add more cav to deal with
  artillery
- ship whatever suits you, the lombard+700c is a good choice, marco polo for raiding or the early arsenal if you plan to
  stay in commercial age
- otherwise ship 700 gold and go into fortress age. in this case, build more lombards with your architect, add
  livestock pen and mill. then balance resources and go papal units like crazy. lancers and papal guards mostly to
  complement your musket/pavesier/hussar army.
