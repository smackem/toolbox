# Italy Musket Spam

the goal is to enter commerce age with a strong eco and to quickly build a army to defend until mercs can be deployed.
the problem with italy is that they start with only 3 settlers and do not have access to settler shipments. to make up
for this weakness, they receive a settler for every tech they research.

what this strat delivers is:
- a 5:00 commerce time
- 19 villager population
- all tier1 market techs researched (depending on treasures + tier2 hunting)
- 40 pop space

- all settlers go to hunt except 1 that goes to crates
- set tc gather point to hunt
- explorer collects treasure with prio 1
- architect queues buildings in front: house, market, house, house
- send in capitalism
- as soon as you have the market up and 50c, research hunting dogs
- age up with the 500f politician
- take half of your settlers to wood, none to gold
- research all remaining market tier1 techs, start with steel traps if you have the resources
- gather points remains on hunt
- on reaching age2, make the architect take a break from house building and build a rax, pay for the foundation to get
  it up quickly
- send in 6 muskets as first shipment
- queue 5 muskets
- architect resumes house, queue another house, another rax, house, stable, house, house, lombard
- keep on queueing parvesiers and muskets
- next card is 3 taverns, use them to collect gold - you do not yet need any vills on gold
- next card is the basilika, place it so that it affects your rax and stable
- you should have come under attack by now and be able to repel it
- if your enemy withdraws, follow him and do as much damage as you can while queueing up more rax units
- set tc gather point to gold and military shipment point to basilika
- research the basilika techs (better line of sight and faster training)
- your next goal is to balance your resources (use the lombard for this) and ship mercs: lancers are great as is
  the crabat+inf shipment
- use the cav mercs to raid relentlessly, don't panic if your enemy goes fortress age - just add more cav to deal with
  artillery
- ship whatever suits you, the lombard is a good choice or the early arsenal if you stay in commerce age
- otherwise ship 700 gold and go into fortress age. in this case, build more lombards with your architect, add
  livestock pen and mill. then balance resources and go papal units like crazy. lancers and papal guards mostly to
  complement your musk/parvesier army.
