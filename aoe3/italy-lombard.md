# Italy Lombard Build

the idea is to turtle and boom, relying on food from livestock pens as main resource, using italy's strengths:
free resource conversion with lombards, low wood dependency due to architects, and papal units + mercs to win :)

the best thing about this strat is that you don't need any map control, just build as defensively as you can.
your explorer only hunts treasures and builds trading posts, he does not scout (use the excellent marco polo card for scouting).

- all settlers to crates except 1 to hunt
- architect builds a market, queue a house and a lombard next
- find coin treasure, if less than 50c available close by: set tc gather point to gold
- as soon as vill is out on gold, set gather point to hunts
- as soon as 50c is collected and market is built: research hunting dogs, pull gold vill to hunts
- send 8 sheep + livestock pen card as first shipment
- when at 10/10 vills, pay for the house foundation (~50w) to finish it quickly, then architect moves on to lombard
- hunt ALL close-by treasures, don't scout, concentrate on treasures!
- age up with tower+200c
- after clicking age up, move 3-4 vills on wood, 1 one gold, all other remain on hunts
- while ageing up, research as many tier1 market techs as possible
- architect queues houses and rax
- when reaching age2, place outpost close to your base, defensively, use gold vill to gather coin
- pay for the rax foundations to finish it quickly, move the architect on to house
- you should have 300f by now, put them in the lombard
- send lombard wagon+700res card next
- keep sending vills to hunt/berry bushes
- build a few parvesiers or muskets to defend
- concentrate on equaling out resource stocks with the lombards
- send basilica card or units next, depending on enemy pressure
- next goal is to send one merc shipment for further defense (crabat+stravione e.g. or lancers)
- after merc shipment is out, hop into age3 - use vills to build seconds livestock pen, architect builds farms
- have something like 30 vills on food, 5 on wood, 5 on gold - use lombards like crazy
- build a second architect to construct farms for when berries run out and outposts for defense
- in age3, send papal units and mercs, build native units and rax units - kills anything :)
- shipments are typically:
  - mounted riflemen (great card - they don't need pop space!!)
  - two falcs
  - advanced lombards
  - advanced arsenal
  - parvesier cards
  - mercs
