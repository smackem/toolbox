# The Maltese Falcon

The goal is to use Malta's strengths to pressure your enemy early with a fb and order units, building up to a
deadly blow with malta units.

From the inital blow on, you are free to either go semi-ff or to keep on strangling your enemy in colonial.

outline:
- reach colonial at 4:30 with
- 15/20 pop
- a tower up
- longbows under way

required cards:
- 3 vils
- british tongue
- 700w
- 700c
- german tongue
- 8 pikes
- 9 xbows
- Wignacourt Constructions (gather boost near fortifications)
- flame throwers

nice-to-have:
- 7 totenkopf hussars
- irish brigadiers
- church card
- any age3 unit shipment for semi-ff, but especially 9 fire throwers and Sovereign Order of Malta (malta unit combat)

build order:

- all vills to hunt, 2 to crates, 1 crate vill builds house
- gather point to hunt
- build vills up to 12/20 pop
- ship 3 vills
- age up with 400w
- after clicking age up, send all vills except 5 to wood
- explorer scouts enemy base and builds an outpost close to enemy's hunt or gold
- queue 2 vills while ageing up, you will soon be popped
- set tc gather point to gold
- after reaching age2, gather wood with 4 vills and send british tongue
- the 4 vills then build two houses with the remaining wood and go to hunt
- set both shipment points to your forward tower, so that lbows and commandery wagon pop out there
- build the commandery close to the tower
- don't forget to set the economic gather shipment point back to your tc
- you now have two shooting buildings close to enemy's base
- circle the enemy base with the lbows and pick villagers

## variant 1 - strangle

- ship in pikes or xbows depending on enemy's unit selection
- train another batch of lbows or 2 or 3 hussars to complement this shipment
- next shipment is 700w
- move 2 vills forward, build a hospital behind your shooting buildings and start training hospitaliers
- use your forward vils to build a cannon shop so you can build fire throwers
- you need an eco boost to switch malta units, so the next shipment is either german tongue
  (if you have wood left) or wignacourt
- one of the merc shipments might come in handy at this point. if you think you can overpower your enemy with
  a quick blow, ship in 11 irish muskets for 500c. otherwise go on with malta units.
- never stop harassing your enemy, try to keep your units alive by hiding them in the commandery and getting them out
  just in time to prevent your enemy from destroying the commandery
- meanwhile make use of your explorer - you have the best explorer in the game, since he can build outposts!
  so tower your resource locations to reap the full benefits of wignacourt or use the second commandery to
  train additional settler wagons
- as soon as you have 5-10 hospitaliers and 5 fire throwers, move them in and start attacking enemy structures
- if the game drags on in age 2, you're in an excellent position: good eco thanks to wignacourt, strong unit
  selection thanks to lbows, hospitaliers and fire throwers. send flame throwers later on, it helps a lot :)

## variant 2 - semi ff

- ship in 700c and go to fortress with the 4 hospitaliers politician
- after pressing the age up button, reallocate most vills to wood so you can build a hospital and a cannon shop
- try to keep your lbows alive but don't panic if you lose them and your complete fb
- build your hospital and cannon shop close to your base
- after reaching age 3, send 9 fire throwers
