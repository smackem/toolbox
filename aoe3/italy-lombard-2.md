# Italy Lombard Build

variation of the standard italy lombard build for maps with starting towers (texas, siberia)

- all settlers to crates except 1 to hunt
- architect builds a market, queue a house and a lombard next
- find coin treasure, if less than 50c available close by: set tc gather point to gold
- as soon as vill is out on gold, set gather point to hunts
- as soon as 50c is collected and market is built: research hunting dogs, pull gold vill to hunts
- send 8 sheep + livestock pen card as first shipment
- when at 10/10 vills, pay for the house foundation (~50w) to finish it quickly, then architect moves on to lombard
- hunt ALL close-by treasures, don't scout, concentrate on treasures!
- age up with lombard+vill
- after clicking age up, move 3-4 vills on wood, 1 one gold, all other remain on hunts
- while ageing up, research as many tier1 market techs as possible
- architect queues houses and rax
- when reaching age2, place the lombard in the back
- pay for the rax foundations to finish it quickly, move the architect on to house
- you should have 300f by now, put them in the lombards
- next cards: musketeers / basilica / lombard+700c / two outposts / marco polo, order depending on enemy
- keep sending vills to hunt/berry bushes
- build parvesiers to defend
- concentrate on equaling out resource stocks with the lombards
- next goal is to send one merc shipment for further defense (crabat+stravione e.g. or lancers)
- after merc shipment is out, hop into age3
- while ageing, use vills to build second livestock pen, architect builds farms, houses, lombards
- have something like 30 vills on food, 5 on wood, 5 on gold and use lombards like crazy
- build a second architect to help with construction when berries run out and outposts for defense
- in age3, keep on sending papal units, build native units and rax units - kills anything :)
